% tracks Draw a map of all transect's tracks within a database
%
% [hl] = tracks(D,[TYPE,SUBTYPE,OPTIONS])
% 
% According to max/min of latitude/longitude of all transects within the
% database object D, this function draws a map with all profiles locations.
%
% Options:
% - TYPE: 
%	1: Colorize according to profiles' years:
%		SUBTYPE = 1 (default) per year
%		SUBTYPE = 2 per decade
%		SUBTYPE = 3 per 5 years 
%	2: On a single figure, one subplot per transect of the database.
%	3: (fastest method) No color, only black crosses for each profiles.
%	4: (default) Colorize profiles' location with various fields:
%		SUBTYPE = 1 (default) Station dates
%		SUBTYPE = 2 Station dates by months
%		SUBTYPE = 3 Station number
%		SUBTYPE = 4 Station mixed layer depth
%		SUBTYPE = 5 Station main thermocline depth
%		OPTIONS is the marker type, it can be anyone from the plot function.
%
% Output parameter hl is a table of handles from objects plooted on the figure.
%
% Rq:
%	All plotted object (markers) are tagged with: 'station_location'
%
% Eg:
%	tracks(D);
%	tracks(D,4,1); % Similar to previous call
%	tracks(D,4,4,'s');
