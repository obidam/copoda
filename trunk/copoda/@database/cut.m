% cut Extract a subset of a database based on a regional selection
%
% D = cut(D,[POLYGON])
% 
% Extract from the database D, stations inside POLYGON.
% POLYGON is optional, if you don't specify it, a map of the database
% stations is plotted and you can draw a polygon with mouse clicks.
%
% Inputs:
%	D: database object
%	POLYGON = [LONGITUDE ; LATITUDE] the coordinates of points
%		the drawing the region defined by a polygon
%
% Outputs:
%	D: the subset of database D
%
% Note:
% If no stations are found, the function returns NaN
%
% Eg:
%	% D is your database
%	Dnh = cut(D,[0 360 360 0 0 ; 0 0 90 90 0]);
%	% will extract the Northern Hemisphere stations
