	<h2>COPODA</h2>
	<h3>COllaborative Platform for Ocean Data Analysis</h3>
	
	<p>It is a Matlab package based on the use of Matlab classes to manage, manipulate and work with hydrographic datas from various origins.</p><br>

	<p>Available hydrographic datas are distributed in many different formats (such as netcdf, grib, mat, hsv, etc ...) and sometimes using different conventions.</p><br>

	<p>Although they are very large databases aiming at uniforming such datas (hydrobase for example), scientists often have to compare, merge and work with informations coming from different sources and therefore have to develop custom routines to perform standard diagnostics.</p><br>

	<p><b>The primary goal of COPODA is to provide an uniform and collaborative platform for diagnostics development under Matlab</b>. It provides an interface between different datas (and as many sources) and diagnostics users would like to perform on them so that diagnostics could be written independently of the data format (see the schematic here after).</p>
