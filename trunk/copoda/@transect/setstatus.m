% setstatus Set the status of an odata object in a transect data property
%
% T = setstatus(T,VARNAME,STATUS)
% 
% Set the status of variable(s) given by VARNAME (odata fields in transect.data)
% to STATUS.
%
% Inputs:
%	T: Transect object
%	VARNAME: a cell of strings or a string with the transect.data property name(s) of
%		odata object(s), ie anyone return by datanames(T)
%	STATUS: a string with 'R' or 'V' to indicate the status of variables given by VARNAME
%		If more than one variables are given by VARNAME and length of STATUS is 1, all
%		variables status will be set to STATUS.
%
% Outputs:
%	T: Update transect object
%
% Eg:
%	T = setstatus(T,'OXYK','V');
%	T = setstatus(T,{'OXYK';'OXSL'},'V');
