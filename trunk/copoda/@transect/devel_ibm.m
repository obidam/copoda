% Geostrophic currents and transports between station 
% pairs are calculated relative to a deep reference level, or 
% the depth of the shallowest station along sloping bot- 
% tom. Large mass imbalances are found between the sec- 
% tions based on this initial guess, and an inverse model is 
% used to adjust the flow and estimate uncertainties on 
% diagnostics.

% The basic inverse model technique follows that of Wunsch 
% (1996) using a Gaussâ€“Markov method to estimate ref- 
% erence-level velocities and Ekman transport along the 
% hydrographic sections enclosing the domain so that the 
% circulation satisfies basic conservation requirement 
% (e.g., Ganachaud 2003). Mass, heat, 
% and salt conservation constraints 
% are applied over isopycnal layers defined by po- 
% tential density surfaces
