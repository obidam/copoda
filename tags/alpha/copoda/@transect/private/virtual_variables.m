% virtual_VTST Compute a virtual variable
%
% C = virtual_variables(T,VNAME)
% 
% From the transect object datas T, this function computes the
% "virtual" variable named VNAME. 
% A virtual variable is an odata object within the transect data 
% list which has meta informations (name, unit, etc ...) but no content.
%
% This function should be called by transect/subsref.m
%
% The status (REAL/VIRTUAL) of an odata object is set by 
% the T.data.PARAMETERS_STATUS variable.
