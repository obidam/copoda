% length Give back the number of transects within a database object
%
% N = length(D,[OPT])
% 
% Return the number N of transects within the database object D which are
% not empty (for which isempty(D.transect{i}) returns false)
%
% Inputs:
%	D: a database object
%	OPT:
%		0 (default): returns the number of non-empty transects
%		1: returns the total number of transects
%
% Created: 2009-07-30.
% Rev. by Guillaume Maze on 2010-04-22: now returns only nb of transects, 
%		because we implemented the function 'size'.
