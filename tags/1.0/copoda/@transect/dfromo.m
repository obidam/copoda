% dfromo Compute station distance (km) to an origin
%
% [D] = dfromo(T,O)
% 
% Compute the distance D (km) of each stations in transect object T
% from a point O defined by: latitude/longitude
% Example:
%	d = dfromo(T,[317.5 59.8]); % Compute distance to Greenland
%
% [D K] = dfromo(T,O);
% When two outputs are required, D is sorted and K contained indices
% to sort T.
