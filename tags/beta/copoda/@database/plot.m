% plot(D,VARN1,[VARN2])
%
% Plot a histogram among samples of D of the variable VARN1 (a field
% from datanames(D).
% VARN1 can also be 'time' to show the number of stations per year.
%
% If VARN2 is specified (again, a field from datanames(D)), the function
% plots the scatter plots VARN1 vs VARN2
%
