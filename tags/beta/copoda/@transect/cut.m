% cut Extract a subset of a transect based on a regional selection
%
% T = cut(T,[POLYGON])
% 
% Extract from the transect T, stations inside POLYGON.
% POLYGON is optional, if you don't specify it, a map of the transect
% stations is plotted and you can draw a polygon with mouse clicks.
%
% Inputs:
%	T: transect object
%	POLYGON = [LONGITUDE ; LATITUDE] the coordinates of points
%		the drawing the region defined by a polygon
%
% Outputs:
%	T: the subset of transect T
%
% Note:
% If no stations are found, the function returns NaN
%
% Eg:
%	% T is your transect
%	Tnh = cut(T,[0 360 360 0 0 ; 0 0 90 90 0]);
%	% will extract the Northern Hemisphere stations
