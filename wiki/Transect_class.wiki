= The Transect class =

One instance of a Transect class is called a Transect object. A Transect gather information and measurements from a single platform, i.e. a cruise or a unique Argo profiler.
All Transect objects have the following properties:

|| Properties ||	Type || Description ||
|| source || string || Description of the data source (your lab's name for example). By default it is: 'Laboratoire de Physique des Oceans, Brest' ||
|| creator || string || Description of who created the object (your name for example or login as filled by default) ||
|| file || string || File name with original datas ||
|| file_date || datenum || System date of the file containing original datas ||
|| created || datenum || The date the Transect object was created (by default it is set to the output of Matlab's function now) ||
|| modified || datenum || The date the Transect object was last modified (by default it is set to the current date but updated every time one of the other properties is modified) ||
|| cruise_info || class cruise_info || Basic informations about the cruise (see this section for more details)||
|| geo || struct || Informations about measurements localization. This is were matrices with longitude, latitude, depth, pressure, etc takes place. (See here for more details).||
|| data || struct || List of OData objects with measurements. (See here for more details). ||
|| prec || struct || Informations about the precisions of measurements. NOT USED RIGHT NOW ||

When a call to the default constructor is made on the Matlab prompt, Transect informations are formatted specifically and the display is like:

Every one of the default properties are displayed here.
All properties are accessible through the dot connector, ie if T is a Transect object, you can access properties by typing:
{{{
>> T.source
ans =
Laboratoire de Physique des Oceans, Brest
}}}

Let's now go into the details of all properties.

== Basic properties ==

Basic properties are `source, creator, file, file_date, created`  and `modified`. They all are self explanatory and can be accessed/modified by simple classic structure mean like:
{{{
>> T.source
>> T.source{:}
>> T.source{1:end}
>> T.modified = now
>> T.creator = 'Your Name'
>> T.creator(1:4) = 'Mine'
}}}
Note that you can use either {} or () to access the content for these properties.
