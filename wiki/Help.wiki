#labels Phase-Support
Soon to be here !

We're working on the already 35 pages documentation to make it shorter and better.

As COPODA is still on a very early stage release, the documentation may change significantly for some features and is therefore not public yet.

If you're interested in participating actively to the development of COPODA, please send an email to: copoda@guillaumemaze.org
